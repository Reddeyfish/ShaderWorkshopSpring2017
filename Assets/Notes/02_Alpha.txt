To have the shader take alpha into account, we need to add a few lines.
<New Shader, Custom/Alpha>

In subshader

<Add to SubShader

	Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha
	ZWrite Off
	ZTest LEqual
	Lighting Off
>

These keywords set up the shader to use alpha blending. Once the object has been rendered, it needs to be combined with the scene.
The resulting color is the rendered color times it's alpha, plus the background color times oneMinusSourceAlpha. You can set up different blending modes.
For example, Additive blending is Blend One One to add the two together.

ZTest states that we'll only render if we are closer to the camera than any occluding objects.
ZWrite off states that the rendered object won't occlude objects.

<Create Material, apply it>

We also need to set up a tags block to tell Unity to render this shader with other transparent shaders

<add to Subshader
	Tags { "Queue"="Transparent" "RenderType"="Transparent" "IgnoreProjector" = "True" "PreviewType"="Plane" }
